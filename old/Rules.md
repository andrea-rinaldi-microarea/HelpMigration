# Rules
Help sources are organized by language, and then in a folder structure that maps basically the source code of the product:
* language (same as dictionaries, i.e.: ``en``, ``it-IT``, etc.)
  * application (i.e.: ``ERP``)
    * module (i.e.: ``Contacts``)

File names correspond to the namespace of the element they refer to.
